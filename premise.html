<h2>Basic Premise For This Talk</h2>

<b>The overall technology and industry landscape for Data is complex and confusing, but increasingly 
important and relevant.</b>


<h2>Complexity and Confusion</h2>
There are many (inter-related) factors contributing to making this a confusing topic. Below are a few
examples.

<h3>"Data" is a very broad (meta) topic</h3> 
Pretty much everything a computer does is related to manipulating or processing data at
one scale or another. The entire IT industry is about generating, transmitting, recieving,
updating, analyzing, storing, securing (etc) data. 

<h3>"Data Explosion"</h3> 
It is well chronicalled that the total amount of data in the (digital) 
universe is growing at completely unprecidented rates. There are literally thousands of studies,
papers, findings, articles on the subject - so we won't repeat those here. 

<h3>Macro Forces</h3> 
The IT industry and it's corresponding technolgoy and vendor landscape are 
constanly being reshaped by macro forces. Cause and effect are all inter-related. 
Constant technological change leads to relentless improvements in processing power, 
and reductions in physical size, power consumption, and ultimately cost and access to devices. 
Today we can see the drammatic impact that smart mobile devices and nearly ubiquitous internet
connectivity have had on the way computers are used both commercially and by individual consumers.
Stated differently, in technolgoy continue to broaden the usecases for IT equipment, 
which in tern, drive additional requirements around cost, scale, performance, secruity, which drives 
even more innovation. This is a cycle that feeds itself.

<h2>Change Is A Constant</h2>
We have seend a few decades worth of examples as to how change is the one constant in the IT industry.
The rate of change in the landscape of companies providing techologies related to "data"
has been accelerating over the last few years.


<h3>Examples:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Non-Relatinal/NoSQL Databases:</b> Today there are a huge number of NoSQL 
      technolgoies (>160 across 12 categories), offered commerically from a equally large 
      number of vendors.  </li>
  <li><b>"Big Data" data processing tools:</b> Today "Big Data" is an umbrella term that refers 
      to a myriad of new technolgoies developed to store and analyze data in volumes (or at
      velocities) which were previously impossible or impractical (economically).  </li>
  <li><b>Software Defined Storage:</b> The continued forward progress of commodity hardware
       has given rise to a number of "Software Defined Infrastructure" categories - where 
       software on commodity hardware can increasingly replace specialized hardware at a 
       fraction of the cost. "Software Defined Storage" solutions have emerged competing
       with specialize file, block and ojbect storage and offering "hyper-converged" compute
       and storage infrastructures.</li>
</ul>

Notes from Matt

In addition to being meta, the data space is one that has seen a
tremendous amount of upheaval in the past few years.

The rate of change...

In traditional Relational Database systems, there has been an influx
of SQL-like system. For instance, Hive for using new storage systems,
Redshift for providing data storage and query via a new consumption
model, Vertica for analytics focused columnar storage, or simply the
explosion of MySQL-like systems. In addition, there are more SQL
systems that aim to better exploit the storage hierarchy, like
MemSQL.

And that's just the Relational category.

In the Non-Relational/NoSQL category, there are over 150 systems in a
dozen sub-categories trying to balance on different points on the CAP
(Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) spectrum. [Example of
CA system, of CP, AP, some comments about how it's important to know
the use cases to properly select tech]
