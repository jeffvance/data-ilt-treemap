<h1>Overall "Data" Taxonomy</h1>

<h2>What Are We Using For A Taxonomy Internally?</h2>
Red Hat continues to study and refine our product and partnering strategies with respect to the
evolving data landscape. To help structure those discussion we "standardized" on a taxonomy to be 
used internally. 


<h2>Our Taxonomy Through a Series of Pictures</h2>
A series of pictures that <a href="tax1.html">overview</a> our taxonomy, show how we 
<a href="tax2.html">dreived</a> it, show <a href="tax3.html">where Red Hat is
participating</a> directly, and show 
<a href="tax4.html">where "popularity" data is available</a> (on usage and usage trends).


<h2>Explore Our Taxonomy (interactive)</h2>
Click 
<a href="tax-indented-tree.html">here</a> 
view the Overall Data Taxonomy as an 'clickable' indented tree (which also shows which categories Red Hat has products in).

<h2>DB-Engines Popularity Scoring</h2>
Red Hat is currently using data published by Solid IT on a site called “DB-Engines”. We belive this 
is a very nice piece of research. Essentially this work is an example of “sentiment analysis”, a popular
example of a BIg Data wworkload on multiple public data sources.
