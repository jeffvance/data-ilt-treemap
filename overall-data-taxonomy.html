<h1>Overall "Data" Taxonomy</h1>

<h2>Ideal would be...</h2>
Ideally, there would be a single, standard, "taxonomy" that neatly describes the entire "Data"
landscape. If such a "taxonomy" existed we would have a standard set of "categories", with straight
forward, definitions for each category. It would be easy for customers or developers to figure out
which technologies solve which problems, and which vendors provide which technologies. So assuming
customers and developers understand the problems they have, life would be good.

<h2>Reality Check...</h2>
The status quo doesn't resembled the above ideal state. There is not single "taxonomy" for data. 
New technolgoies and new vendors pop up (literally) daily. The rate of change is not constant or 
uniform - some areas are more mature and stable - but there is a general lack of clean/standard
categories even for the older more mature parts of the data landscape.

<p>Industry analysts both 
help solve this problem and contribute to it. Individual industry analyts to a great job of
coming up with frameworks to help their clients understand what's going on - and they sell this
insight. That's the good news. The bad news is that they rarely agree on the specific categories, etc.
</p>

</p>Vendors also contribute to the "problem". Vendors inherrently strive to position their products 
in a way that that sets them apart from their competition. They often position their products as being
"comprehensive" addressing customer problems that transcend multiple categories. Vendors (generally)
continuously innovate - thus constantly adding features and functions that potentially blur the 
lines with respect to which category or categories their product(s) fit in. 
</p>

<p>
So we don't have one taxonomy for "Data" we have many. All of them (probalby) have merit, some are 
(undoubtedly) better than others. 

<h2>About Red Hat, With Respect to "Data"...</2>

<h3>Not a consultant, but we are a "trusted advisor"</3>
Red Hat is not in specificaly in the business of creating taxonomies or advising customers which 
vendor to pick. In fact, as a "Platform Software Vendor" with a very large set of partners with 
whom we collaborate and go to market with, and a very large number of ISVs that "run on" or "work
with" our various software products - Red Hat generally strives to be "partner" and "vendor" neutral.

<p>
At the same time, Red Hat does offer some professional services and even beyond that, Red Hat is clearly
considered by customers to be a "Trusted Advisor". In some cases, our neutrality is a part of the 
reason why Red Hat is trusted.
</p>

<h2>Not Historically a "Data"/"Database" Vendor, but Increasingly relevant...</h3>
Red Hat continues to grow our set of products notably expanding our product set beyodn the "Operating 
System" to include middlware, "Open Hybrid Cloud" products (OpenStack and OpenShift), and pushing
into the Storage Software space with Glsuter and Ceph. 

<p>
For the most part, Red Hat historically has not been a "Data" vendor, and specifiall we have not
historically been a "Database" vendor. The later remains true today with one notable excpetion.
Red Hat does provide (test and certified versions) of popular open source databases 
(MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgrSQL) with Red Hat Software Collections.
</p>

<p>
With all the changes in the "Data" technology landscape, corresponding macro industry trends around
"Big Data", "Internet of Things", "Software Defined Infrastructure/Storage", Red Hat's expanding 
product portfolio, and the (obvious) emphasis on IT transformations around "Cloud" and "DevOps" - 
"Data" is becoming increasingly important. This is evidenced in the Red Hat Summit "IoT" demo and 
it's heavy reliance on Apache Spark as a Data Processing (analytics) framework/technolgoy. All of 
Red Hat's initiatives are increasingly focus on "applications", "application devlopers", on "workloads",
on DevOps and Dual Mode IT (especially Mode 2, Agile IT/Emerging Aplicaitons). Any talk on any 
of those subjects would likely feature a discussion of one or more of the newer "data" technolgoies
(NoSQL, Hadoop, Spark, Streaming, etc) and how they are key "enablers" for IT transformation. 
</p>

<p>
With Red Hat being in the Storae Software business, we are acatually directly participating in 
one key area. Red Hat's storage portfolio today include Gluster and Ceph with together provide
industry leading, highly competive, scalable, cost effective "Software Defined Storage" products
providing file, block and object storage. We are actively working to insure our stroage products
are well integrate with our own products as well as key thrid party products through partnerships
and ISV relationships.
</p>

<h3>Thus...</h3>
Red Hat continues to study and refine our product and partnering strategies with respect to the
evolving data landscape.
