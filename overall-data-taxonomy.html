<h1>Overall "Data" Taxonomy</h1>

<h2>In a perfect World...</h2>
Ideally, there would be a single, standard, "taxonomy" that neatly describes the entire "Data"
landscape. If such a "taxonomy" existed we would have a standard set of "categories", with straight
forward, definitions for each category. It would be easy for customers or developers to figure out
which technologies solve which problems, and which vendors provide which technologies. Assuming
customers and developers understand the problems they need to solve (ie: their detailed requirements), 
life would be good.

<h2>Reality Check...</h2>
The status quo doesn't resemble the above ideal state - at least not with respect to the technolgoy
and vendor landscape for "data". There is no single "taxonomy" for data and there are several reasons 
why.
New technolgoies and new vendors pop up (literally) daily. The rate of change is not constant or 
uniform - some areas are more mature and stable - but there is a general lack of clean/standard
categories even for the older more mature parts of the data landscape.

<p>Industry analysts both help solve this problem and contribute to it. 
Individual industry analyts to an excellent job of coming up with frameworks to help their clients 
understand what's going on - and they sell this insight. In particular, IDC, 451, Forrester, and 
Gartner all have numerous, excellent, and hightly relevant research reports etc.  That's the good news. 
The bad news is that they rarely agree on the specific categories, etc. Each analyst takes 
pride in having "the best" research - this is where the differentiate and try to make money.
Inconsistencies across reports can leave customers/develper wonder which report to believe or 
confused for other reasons.
</p>

</p>Vendors also contribute to the "problem". Vendors inherrently strive to position their own products 
in a way that that sets them apart from their competition. They emphasize their own strengths but rarely 
mention their limitations (and do the converse for their competitors). Vendors often position their 
products as being "comprehensive", claiming to address customer problems that transcend multiple 
categories. No vendor wants to appear as a "niche player". Vendors (ideally) continuously innovate - 
thus constantly adding features and functions that potentially blur the 
lines with respect to which category or categories their product(s) fit in. 
</p>

<p>
All of these factors help explain why there is no single agreed upon taxonomy for "Data". 
Instead of one, there are many.  To be fair, is likely that most reports published by analysts or 
vendors have merit individually. In some case, specific reports are "specialized" 
and "zoom in" on one part of the landscape and cover it well. As a resulut, some reports are
better than others (more complete or correct, etc). We aren't endorsing or criticizing any 
existing industry analyst work here.  We are simply noting we have not found any single source 
that meets all of our own internal needs (broad, objective, accurate, data driven, transparent, etc). 
that is broad, accurate, up to date, open/transparent with respect to it's methodology, etc. 
This leave Red Hat having to piece the picture together from various sources (or do the analysis 
ourselves). Wee suspect other are in the same or similar boat.

<h2>About Red Hat, With Respect to "Data"...</h2>

<h3>Red Hat "neutral" and "trusted advisor"</h3>
Red Hat is not in specificaly in the business of creating taxonomies or advising customers which 
vendor to pick. In fact, as a "Platform Software Vendor" with a very large set of partners with 
whom we collaborate and go to market with, and a very large number of ISVs that "run on" or "work
with" our various software products - Red Hat generally strives to be "partner" and "vendor" neutral.

<p>
At the same time, Red Hat does offer some professional services and even beyond that, Red Hat is clearly
considered by customers to be a "Trusted Advisor". In some cases, our neutrality is a part of the 
reason why Red Hat is trusted.
</p>

<h3>Not Historically a "Data"/"Database" Vendor, but Increasingly relevant...</h3>
Red Hat continues to grow our set of products notably expanding our product set beyodn the "Operating 
System" to include middlware, "Open Hybrid Cloud" products (OpenStack and OpenShift), and pushing
into the Storage Software space with Glsuter and Ceph. 

<p>
For the most part, Red Hat historically has not been a "Data" vendor, and specifiall we have not
historically been a "Database" vendor. The later remains true today with one notable excpetion.
Red Hat does provide (test and certified versions) of popular open source databases 
(MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgrSQL) with Red Hat Software Collections.
</p>

<p>
With all the changes in the "Data" technology landscape, corresponding macro industry trends around
"Big Data", "Internet of Things", "Software Defined Infrastructure/Storage", Red Hat's expanding 
product portfolio, and the (obvious) emphasis on IT transformations around "Cloud" and "DevOps" - 
"Data" is becoming increasingly important. This is evidenced in the Red Hat Summit "IoT" demo and 
it's heavy reliance on Apache Spark as a Data Processing (analytics) framework/technolgoy. All of 
Red Hat's initiatives are increasingly focus on "applications", "application devlopers", on "workloads",
on DevOps and Dual Mode IT (especially Mode 2, Agile IT/Emerging Aplicaitons). Any talk on any 
of those subjects would likely feature a discussion of one or more of the newer "data" technolgoies
(NoSQL, Hadoop, Spark, Streaming, etc) and how they are key "enablers" for IT transformation. 
</p>

<p>
Today, Red Hat is in the Storage Software business. As a result, we are actually directly 
participating in one of the key areas. Red Hat's storage portfolio today includes Gluster and Ceph 
which, together provide industry leading, highly competive, scalable, cost effective "Software Defined 
Storage" soltuions for providing file, block and object storage. We are actively working to insure 
our stroage products are well integrate with our own products (especially OpenStack, OpenShift, RHEL
and RHEL Atomic) as well as key Third Party products through engineering/strategic partnerships and 
ISV relationships.
</p>


<h2>Overall Data Taxonomy Red Hat is using (internally)</h2>
Red Hat continues to study and refine our product and partnering strategies with respect to the
evolving data landscape. To help structure those discussion we "standardized" on a taxonomy to be 
used internally. 

<p>
To avoid (overly) boiling the ocean we are primarily looking at three high level areas.

<ul>
<li>
Database Landscape - Covering the wide and growing array of "database" technolgies and vendors. Here
is where you will find all the relational and non-relational databses (the later being a very diversified
group). 
</li>
<li>
Data Processing/Analytics - This area is especially tricky becuase there are is a lot of duplicity 
in intent. For now we have chosen to segregate base on "old vs new". We lump the tradtional tools and
technolgoies built around tradtional relational databases under the heading of "Busienss Intelligence" and
use the category of "Data Processing" to cover the new technolgoies that specialize in analytics on 
unstrctured data. 
</li>
<li>
Storage Software - 
</li>
<ul>
