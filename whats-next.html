<h1>What's Next?</h1>


<h2>Applied Data Scient Project</h2>

Red Hat has an internal "Applied Data Scient Team" (operated our of our "Emerging Technology" team). 
Evaluating / scoring "popularity" for various "data" technolgies, is a good exmple of an applying 
data analytics, to unstructured data, to derive insight. 

Red Hat will (likely) do a project to quantitative score all offerings in all categories (of the unified
taxonomy we are using). Rationale for Red Hat to do this project:


<ul>
<li>
Gives us complete "coverage" of the overall data landscape (not just database subset)
</li>
<li>
Control: we can weight sources however we want, etc. 
</li>
<li>
Can (hopefully) highlight strengths of storage offerings
</li>
<li>
Makes an excellent demo of how to use best in class tools with RHT products to solve 
a real-world (important) problem When? 
</li>
<li>
Post RHT Summit
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Is there general interest?</h3>
