<p>
The landscape of technologies companies providign techologies related to "data"
has been rapidly changing over the last few years. 
</p>

<b Examples:>
<ul>
  <li>Non-Relatinal/NoSQL Databases: today there are a huge number (~xxx) of NoSQL 
      technolgoies, offered commericall from a equally large number of vendors. 
  </li>
  <li>"Big Data" data processing tools: </li>
  <li>Software Defined Storage: </li>
</ul> 

<p>
Currently this does not work with Google Chrome Browser, but should work correctly
with both Safari and Firefox. This will be fixed later when we host the web-page
with with a webserver, etc.

select 		Allows user to "select" a criteria (eg: size or count) to visualize
                on; implemented as a mutually exclusive selection criteria
click +/-	Allows user to click an object (usually to expand/collapse detail
                underneath that object)
zoom  		Allows user to "zoom" in on a point of reference by clicking it (and 
                zoom back out by clicking elsewhere).

All database    A full list of all database offering (relational and non-relational)
                including more obscure offerings and offering types (no filtering).

All categories  A list of all the categories, including the non-database categories, 
                not all the entries.

*               These visualizaitons should support some sort of "cutoff" criteria,
                to allow user to filter.
**              This visualization currently has no labels; need to implement labels
                or some sort of mouse-over/hover to allow user to indentify details.
