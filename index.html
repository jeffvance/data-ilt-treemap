 The landscape of technologies companies providign techologies related to "data"
 has been rapidly changing over the last few years.

<h3>Examples:</h3>
<ul>
 <li><b>Non-Relatinal/NoSQL Databases:</b> Today there are a huge number of NoSQL technolgoies (>160 across 12 categories), offered commerically from a equally large number of vendors. </li>
 <li><b>"Big Data" data processing tools:</b> Today "Big Data" is an umbrella term that refers to a myriad of new technolgoies devloped to store and analyze data in volumes (or at velocities) which were previously impossible or impractical (economically). </li>
  <li><b>Software Defined Storage:</b> The continued forward progress of commidity hardware has given rise to a number of "Software Defined Infrastructure" categories - where software on commodity hardware can increasingly replace specialized hardware at a fraction of the cost. "Software Defined Storage" solutions have emerged competing with specialize file, block and ojbect storage and offering "hyper-converged" compute and storage infrastructures.</li>

Notes/explanations...

Key: 
===================================================================================
select 		Allows user to "select" a criteria (eg: size or count) to visualize
                on; implemented as a mutually exclusive selection criteria
click +/-	Allows user to click an object (usually to expand/collapse detail
                underneath that object)
zoom  		Allows user to "zoom" in on a point of reference by clicking it (and 
                zoom back out by clicking elsewhere).

All database    A full list of all database offering (relational and non-relational)
                including more obscure offerings and offering types (no filtering).

All categories  A list of all the categories, including the non-database categories, 
                not all the entries.

*               These visualizations should support some sort of "cutoff" criteria,
                to allow user to filter.
**              This visualization currently has no labels; need to implement labels
                or some sort of mouse-over/hover to allow user to indentify details.

<h2>
Known Bugs/Limitations
</h2>
<p>
Currently this does not work with Google Chrome Browser, but should work correctly
with both Safari and Firefox. This will be fixed later when we host the web-page
with with a webserver, etc.
