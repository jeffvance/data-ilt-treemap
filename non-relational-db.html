<h1>Non-Relational Databases</h1>

<h2>Abundance of New Technolgoies</h2>
<p>
In recent years there has been an explosion of non-relational database technologies. As is the often the 
case, many of the new technologies were created out of "necesity". Specifically many of the newer, 
more scalable, non-relational databases were develped by the highly innovative Internet "pioneers".
Companies such as FaceBook, Amazon, and Google developed Cassandra, Hbase, DynamoDB, BigTable and others.
These companies were among the first to encounter intractable issues with scaling and cost that 
were simply unsolvable with tradtional relational databases.

<h2>Abundance of OpenSource</h2>
In many cases, these technologies were open sourced, other companies and developers joined in, and then 
more companies formed to provide the commercial support required for broad mainstream adoption.
Not all


developers and companies have been increasingly likely to consider alternatives to legacy relational infrastructure. In some cases the motivation is technical — such as a need to scale or perform beyond the capabilities of their existing systems — while in other cases companies are driven by the desire to identify viable alternatives to expensive proprietary software. A third motivation is agility or speed of development, as companies look to adapt to the market more quickly and embrace agile development methodologies.

These drivers apply both to analytical and transactional applications. Companies are shifting workloads to Hadoop for their offline, analytical workloads, and they are building online, operational applications with a new class of data management technologies called "NoSQL", or "Not Only SQL", such as MongoDB.
Development teams have a strong say in the technology selection process. This community tends to find that the relational data model is not well aligned with the needs of their applications. Consider:
• Developers are working with new data types — structured, semi-structured, unstructured and polymorphic data — and massive volumes of it.
• Long gone is the twelve-to-eighteen month waterfall development cycle. Now small teams work in agile sprints, iterating quickly and pushing code every week or two, even every day.
• Object-oriented programming is the norm, and developers need a data model that aligns with this approach, that is easy to use and that provides flexibility.
• Organizations are now turning to scale-out architectures using commodity servers and cloud computing instead of large monolithic architectures. NoSQL systems share several key characteristics. When compared to relational databases,

NoSQL systems are more scalable and provide superior performance. As companies evaluate NoSQL products, they should consider 5 critical dimensions to make the right choice for their applications and their businesses. In this Introduction 2 paper, we describe these dimensions and show why MongoDB is the most widely used NoSQL database in the market.
