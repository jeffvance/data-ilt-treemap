<h2>About this page...</h2>

This webpage provides background context, and content, for our Red Hat Summit
session entitled: 
<b><i>"Make a data-driven investment decision about big data"</i></b>.
</p>

<h2>Caveats and Credits</h2>
<p>
The content of this talk relies heavilly on data from the 
<a href="http://db-engines.com/en">DB-Engines</a>
web site. We want to give full credit to 
<a href="http://solid-it.at/nosql_offers">Solid IT,</a>
the company that  maintains and supports the 
<a href="http://db-engines.com/en">DB-Engines</a>
web-site. 
</p>

<p>
Red Hat is not specifically endorsing this data as either
perfectly correct or complete, but does want to recognize one of, if not the most, complete sources 
of data on the emerging and rapidly changing "Database" Technolgoy landscape.
