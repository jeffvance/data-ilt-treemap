<h2>Title: Make a data-driven investment decision about big data</h2>

<h2>Reduced Scope For This Talk</h2>
<p>
The original speaker for this session was supposed to be Scott McClellan. Due to some personal 
conflicts Scott was not able to attend Red Hat Summit this year. As result of Scott not being able
to attend, we have reduced the scope for what we are going to talk about today.

<h2>Revised Abstract</h2>
<p>
<i>
The technology landscape related to "data" and "data technologies" has dramatically changed over the 
last 10 years. Today the "buzz" around "Big Data" is stronger than ever. 
</p>

<p>
In this session, we will talk about the "taxonomy" we are using internally within Red Hat 
so that we can continue to refine our strategy. As we continue to refine our strategy with respect to 
"big data" at Red Hat, we found that we needed some kind of common "framework" to help us make decsions
(prioritize potential product or partner strategies, etc). Our hypothesis is that many people attending 
Red Hat Summit will be partially familiar with the extent to which the technolgoy and vendor landscape 
has been changing, and suspect that there maybe some broader interest and applicability for the the
framwork we are using. We hope this will help you understand the complex web of technologies that 
make up the big data ecosystem, or at least provide you with a way to think about how these 
technolgies may impact you and your company.

In todays talk we will mostly focus on publicly available data from a third party that provides 
some insight into the relative "popularity" of various "database technolgoies". The overall technolgoy 
landscape for data is much broader than just "databases", but we will focus mostly on databases because
there are an astonishing number of new technolgies just within "databases" and because there is 
useful, public data available.

<p><b>NOTE</b></p>
This is "work in progress" at Red Hat, so this talk is in some sense preliminary. We will talk 
about some potential next steps for Red Hat in this area, and we are interested in feedback from 
that can potentially help use shape our next steps (perhaps to help address the specfic questions
that we cannot answer today with the data and research available).

Notes from Matt -

Red Hat is no longer a single product company. We have a phenominally
strong base in the Enterprise Linux operating system, but also have
products in the Cloud space, both for infrastructure and workflow
management, in Storage, with file, block and object software defeined
storage offerings, in developer enablement with the JBoss suite of
technologies, in mobile with the newly released Red Hat Mobile
Application Platform.

The complexities of evaluating these products in addition to new
technologies, new businesses, partnerships, ecosystem enablement and
the myriad interactions between these things requires modern
approaches and unsurprisingly data.

Trying to capture all the complexities across all Red Hat's businesses
is a herculean undertaking.

Trying to make sense of the complexities is exponentially more
difficult.

As you'd expect, when computer scientists with a predilection for
business value are confronted with such difficulties it's natural to
employ a divide and conquer strategy.

Today I'm going to walk you through some of the work we've done
specifically around technologies in the "data" space.

Not only because it's fun to be meta and use data to describe the data
space, but because it's in the title of the talk...but it IS really
fun to be meta.
