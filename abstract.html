<h2>Abstact</h2>
<p>
The definition and scope of big data is very loosely defined. The value it offers and the best way to 
measure that value is even more hazy. As technology landscapes change and consolidate systems, it 
becomes even more challenging to know where enterprises need to focus to gain tangible value from 
big data.

In this session, we’ll give you the tools you need to make an informed investment decision about big 
data. We’ll help you understand the complex web of technologies that make up the big data ecosystem, 
and give you a tool to navigate the new open source communities and commercial technology options. 
And we’ll tell you how Red Hat has enabled some of the most demanding big data customers on their path 
to success.
