<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
<i>
The definition and scope of big data is very loosely defined. The value it offers and the best way to 
measure that value is even more hazy. As technology landscapes change and consolidate systems, it 
becomes even more challenging to know where enterprises need to focus to gain tangible value from 
big data.

In this session, we’ll give you the tools you need to make an informed investment decision about big 
data. We’ll help you understand the complex web of technologies that make up the big data ecosystem, 
and give you a tool to navigate the new open source communities and commercial technology options. 
And we’ll tell you how Red Hat has enabled some of the most demanding big data customers on their path 
to success.

Notes from Matt -

Red Hat is no longer a single product company. We have a phenominally
strong base in the Enterprise Linux operating system, but also have
products in the Cloud space, both for infrastructure and workflow
management, in Storage, with file, block and object software defeined
storage offerings, in developer enablement with the JBoss suite of
technologies, in mobile with the newly released Red Hat Mobile
Application Platform.

The complexities of evaluating these products in addition to new
technologies, new businesses, partnerships, ecosystem enablement and
the myriad interactions between these things requires modern
approaches and unsurprisingly data.

Trying to capture all the complexities across all Red Hat's businesses
is a herculean undertaking.

Trying to make sense of the complexities is exponentially more
difficult.

As you'd expect, when computer scientists with a predilection for
business value are confronted with such difficulties it's natural to
employ a divide and conquer strategy.

Today I'm going to walk you through some of the work we've done
specifically around technologies in the "data" space.

Not only because it's fun to be meta and use data to describe the data
space, but because it's in the title of the talk...but it IS really
fun to be meta.
