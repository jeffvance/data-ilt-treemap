<h2>
Background/Motivation
</h2>

<p>
The rate of change in the landscape of companies providing techologies related to "data"
has been accelerating over the last few years.
</p>

<h3>
Examples:
</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Non-Relatinal/NoSQL Databases:</b> Today there are a huge number of NoSQL 
      technolgoies (>160 across 12 categories), offered commerically from a equally large 
      number of vendors.  </li>
  <li><b>"Big Data" data processing tools:</b> Today "Big Data" is an umbrella term that refers 
      to a myriad of new technolgoies developed to store and analyze data in volumes (or at
      velocities) which were previously impossible or impractical (economically).  </li>
  <li><b>Software Defined Storage:</b> The continued forward progress of commodity hardware
       has given rise to a number of "Software Defined Infrastructure" categories - where 
       software on commodity hardware can increasingly replace specialized hardware at a 
       fraction of the cost. "Software Defined Storage" solutions have emerged competing
       with specialize file, block and ojbect storage and offering "hyper-converged" compute
       and storage infrastructures.</li>
</ul>
