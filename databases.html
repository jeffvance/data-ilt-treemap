<h1>All Databases</h1>

"All Databases" essentially aggregates the Relational and Non-Relational Databases categories
together (each is discussed separately, and broken down further). The main purpose in having 
this category is that you can look at the entire "database" space as one big space. The value
of this becomes most clear when you look at the animated visualiations below.
